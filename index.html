  <h1>Assignment Submission Explanation</h1>

  <p>
    I followed the assignment instructions and completed the required work,
    but I encountered issues with Git that prevented me from pushing my files
    to the repository.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, the repository contains screenshots that show the work I completed
    and the errors I received when attempting to push the files. These screenshots
    are meant to document that I did the assignment and to provide evidence of the
    Git issues I ran into.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please refer to the screenshots in the repository for details on the completed
    work and the Git error messages.
