        This site wants to make sure you get notified in the way that works best for you.
        Some people like subtle nudges. Others want loud, unmistakable signals.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let’s start simple: <em>how do you prefer to be alerted?</em>
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <!-- Bootstrap 5 JS -->

  <!-- Part Two: Color Commentary -->
<section class="mt-5 p-4 bg-white shadow-sm rounded">

  <h2 class="mb-3">Maybe You Prefer Color?</h2>

  <p>
    Alright, alright… maybe alerts aren’t your thing. Maybe you’re more of a 
    <em>“just change the text color and call it a day”</em> kind of person.
  </p>

  <p>
    If that’s the case, I can offer you a few classic, respectable options:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="text-primary">Blue — calm, trustworthy, very professional.</li>
    <li class="text-success">Green — friendly, optimistic, slightly outdoorsy.</li>
    <li class="text-danger">Red — bold, dramatic, possibly shouting.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    But then again… maybe you’re not here for “classic” or “respectable.”
    Maybe — and I’m just thinking out loud — you want something a little more…
    <strong>chaotic</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Something that shifts colors constantly.  
    Something that whispers, “Yes, I am the rainbow text your parents warned you about.”
  </p>

  <p>
    If that’s even possible, of course.  
    <em>(Is it? Should it be? Should anyone have that kind of power?)</em>
  </p>

</section>

<!-- Part Three: The Big, Loud Finale -->
<section class="mt-5 p-5 text-white bg-danger rounded shadow-sm">

  <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold text-center">
    ALRIGHT, YOU WANT BIG AND LOUD?
  </h2>

  <p class="lead mt-4 text-center">
    Fine. Here it is. The ultimate alert. The alert to end all alerts.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-3 text-center">
    No subtlety. No gentle nudges. Just pure, unfiltered, high‑volume notification energy.
  </p>

  <p class="fw-semibold text-center mt-4">
    Consider yourself officially, unmistakably, undeniably ALERTED.
